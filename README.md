# YouTube Stream Page

Just trying to improve the YouTube live stream watch page. We want the chat next to the video, and the video should take as much space as possible.

## Installation
Well, you used to be able to just download CRX files and install them as an extension, but Chrome won't let you do that any more.

Until the extension is in the Chrome Webstore, you'll need to enable developer mode in your extension page, and load the unpacked extension.
